              Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has described the Queen
              as an inspiration in an entry in a book of condolence at her
              official residence in Edinburgh:
            </p>

            <p>
              "On behalf of Scotland, I express deep sorrow on the passing of
              Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth, and also the gratitude of our nation
              for her steadfast service, dedication and abiding love of
              Scotland.
            </p>

            <p>
              "In so many ways, and for so many of us, she was Elizabeth, Queen
              of Scots. "Personally, I will cherish and value for the rest of my
              life the words of wisdom and counsel I was so privileged to
              receive during the audiences she graciously afforded. "In our
              sadness, we will continue to be guided by her example and
              inspiration. Thank you, Ma'am, may you rest in peace."
