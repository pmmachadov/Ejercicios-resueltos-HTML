          <div class="text_news">
            <p>
              The government plans to move nuclear and renewable electricity
              generators to lower price contracts to cut bills, Prime Minister
              Liz Truss has said. "Renewable and nuclear generators will move on
              to contracts for difference, to end the situation where
              electricity prices are set by the marginal price of gas," Truss
              told Parliament. The price paid to these companies is often set by
              the most costly generator. That is currently hugely expensive gas.
              Moving nuclear and renewable generators onto lower-priced
              contracts "will mean that generators are receiving a fair price
              reflecting their cost of production, further bringing down the
              cost of this intervention," Truss said.
            </p>

            <p>
              The government will ask renewable and nuclear generators to take
              up new 10 or 15-year contracts at fixed prices well below the
              current rates, sources familiar with the discussions say. Liz
              Truss says she won't introduce a windfall tax on energy companies,
              but she will need to address the issue of their huge profits. The
              energy market consultancy Cornwall Insight estimates energy prices
              are likely to be more than Â£40bn higher because of the fact that
              some electricity generators are being paid based on the hugely
              inflated gas price. That is a particularly pressing issue when the
              government is planning to spend tens of billions of pounds of
              taxpayers' money subsidising the nation's energy bills. Paying
              renewable energy companies less than the market price for gas
              would mean a very significant reduction in revenues for them, at
              least in the medium term. Yet RenewableUK, the industry body which
              represents most of the wind power companies in this group, has
              accepted this approach in principle. "We're keen to work
              collaboratively with the government" on the issue, RenewableUK's
              CEO Dan McGrail said. "It makes no sense to allow the exorbitantly
              expensive cost of gas to set the price for the whole of the
              electricity market", he said. How much are energy bills rising
              under the new plan? What is the windfall tax on oil and gas
              companies? What is fracking? RenewableUK represents most of the
              biggest renewable businesses in the UK including Orsted, Scottish
              Power, SSE, RWE and EDF. It confirms its members have had a
              "series of discussions" with the government on the issue and says
              it is waiting for the government to "take a position". So, why
              might they accept this huge potential hit to profits?
            </p>

            <p>
              RenewableUK says it is because the companies recognise it isn't
              fair for consumers to face such high prices at a time of national
              crisis. Those close to the discussions say they are probably also
              being offered a generous long-term price to reflect the short-term
              loss of profits. Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told
              BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday that such long-term
              fixed-price contracts would have the effect of ensuring huge
              profits for electricity companies for years to come. "This is a
              proposal from (energy industry trade association) Energy UK, and
              let's be clear about this proposal: This would lock in massive
              windfall profits for these electricity generators. "Let me explain
              why: what Energy UK have said is we'll accept slightly lower
              prices now, so we can have much higher prices over the following
              15 years. "This would be a terrible deal for the British people, a
              terrible deal for billpayers. "It is much better - if there are
              these unexpected windfalls, and there are - the right thing to do,
              the fair thing to do, is not to do some dodgy deal with these
              companies, but to do a windfall tax. Liz Truss may be
              ideologically opposed to windfall taxes but paying private
              companies billions of pounds in excess profits from the public
              purse is also a political liability. The companies know that if a
              solution isn't found she might deicide she has to hold her nose
              and impose such a tax, and that if she does, she might go after
              the billions of profits the companies have already made.

              High-speed drones whizz along an avalanche's deadly wall of
              tumbling snow, rare Siberian tigers hunt hibernating prey, and
              microscopes capture ice breaking. More than a decade on from the
              first series, Frozen Planet II returns, using new technology to
              give BBC viewers an unprecedented insight into life in the coldest
              parts of our planet, many of which are under huge threat from
              climate change.
            </p>

            <p>
              It took the BBC Natural History Unit (NHU) four and a half years
              of filming across 18 different countries to produce the six-part
              series. The result, Sir David Attenborough reveals in the opening
              sequence, captures "natural phenomena never before seen by
              humans". The success of the series in revealing new animal
              behaviour has already led to one scientific publication on the
              Lapland bumble bee - with more expected to follow.
            </p>

            <p>
              From episode one, viewers will see an endangered Siberian tiger
              (also known as the Amur tiger) prowling for potential sources of
              food sleeping out the winter in caves - the first time this
              activity has been filmed. They are so elusive - with fewer than
              550 left in the world - it took three years to get them on camera.

              The benefit of waiting 11 years for a new series is that camera
              technology has moved on considerably. Microscopes were used to
              film ice cracking below baby emperor penguins' feet as they made
              the treacherous journey to the sea. Motion-triggered time lapse
              cameras were set to catch a tiger on the move. The NHU even
              partnered with space-imaging experts to document the great ice
              melt on a global scale. Perhaps most impressive is the first ever
              use by the NHU of a new generation of light-weight fast-response
              drones. This enabled the team to capture the terrifying first-hand
              experience of flying down the mountainside alongside an avalanche.

              These drones were also used to document a mammoth ice calving in
              Greenland - a fast and difficult to predict event. For more than
              four weeks the team watched on rotation for 24 hours a day, ready
              to send the drones nearly a mile across the ocean to reach the
              vast Store Glacier. The resulting clips immerse the viewer in
              towering blocks of ice, some 100ft (30m) high, as they break away
              from the glacier.
            </p>

            <p>
              Mark Brownlow, executive producer of the series, points out that
              Frozen Planet II is not just about capturing nice footage but also
              "draws attention to changes going on now". Greenland and
              Antarctica are currently losing ice six times faster than 30 years
              ago, and Greenland's ice sheet has been shrinking continuously for
              the last 25 years due to climate change, according to the UN.

              There is humour and heartbreak - and efforts to build a connection
              with the "characters" - as the series producer Elizabeth White
              likes to refer to the animals. In one sequence you're desperately
              willing newborn musk oxen to make it through the first days of
              their brutal lives in the barren world of the frozen tundra. Amid
              the animal drama it's easy to forget that someone was enduring the
              same extremes behind the camera to capture such moments.
            </p>

            <p>
              Alex Lanchester, Frozen Planet II producer, said that "the camera
              operator who filmed the musk ox story had to camp out in the
              Arctic in blizzard conditions". "He towed behind him a garden shed
              on his Skidoo and he lived in that." Besides the difficulties that
              always come with filming in the most treacherous places on Earth,
              this was all done during a global pandemic. One film crew had to
              quarantine for 42 days in South Africa before even beginning their
              trip to Antarctica.

              Although the stars of Frozen Planet II are no doubt the animals,
              the series brings some A-list quality in the soundtrack. Hans
              Zimmer scored the music for the series, and worked with Camila
              Cabello to produce a new song for the trailer. Camila told the
              BBC: "To be able to combine my passion for the planet we live on
              and my music is a dream come true. "Sir David's narration is
              deeply powerful as we try to protect these incredible ecosystems
              from global warming."
