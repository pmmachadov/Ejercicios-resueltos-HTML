        <p>Apple has unveiled the iPhone 14, with emergency satellite connectivity and car crash detection technology,
            at a
            launch event in the US.
            The company revealed four versions of the new handset at its Cupertino headquarters, with an audience
            attending
            in person for the first time since the pandemic.</p>

        <p>It also showed off a new extreme sports wearable - the Watch Ultra.
            The event focused on next generation iPhone, Watch and AirPod products.
            Apple CEO Tim Cook was on stage at the Steve Jobs theatre inside the tech giant's California campus - but
            the
            presentation itself was entirely pre-recorded.

            <p>Changes to the law in April allow bigger, taller phone masts to be built without planning permission
                A council will force telecoms companies to go through a tougher planning process for more phone masts
                following local opposition.
                The government relaxed planning restrictions this year to speed up the rollout of 4G and 5G across
                England.
                It meant taller and broader masts could be installed without the need for council approval.

                <p>But West Berkshire Council has refused recent applications to avoid the full planning process in
                    Newbury
                    and Purley.
                    The council argued the new masts would have a negative impact on the surrounding area, were the
                    wrong
                    colour and were a danger to road safety.
                    Rejecting plans for one 20m high mast at the junction of Shaw Road and Kiln Road in Newbury, council
                    planners said it would have a "detrimental impact" on the appearance of local conservation areas and
                    nearby listed buildings.
                    But some residents affected by the masts are not confident the council can stop the structures being
                    erected.</p>

        <p>It is the first time in seven years the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued an FOI
            enforcement
            notice.

            The Department for International Trade (DIT) had the worst response rate across all government
            departments.

            Action was also taken against the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).

            The ICO is an independent watchdog. Its central aim is to promote openness by public bodies and data
            privacy
            for individuals.

            It has issued this latest action against the DIT and BEIS for what it calls "persistent failures" to
            respond.

            It said the action comes as it renews its approach to regulating the Freedom of Information Act 2000,
            which
            commits to taking action against public authorities with consistently poor performance.</p>

        <p>John Edwards, the Information Commissioner, said: "Accountability and transparency in the work of public
            authorities is fundamental to democracy and it is the ICO's role to ensure that people's right to access
            information is protected.

            "I advise public authorities to take note and learn lessons from the action we have taken today, as we
            will
            be making greater use of our powers under the Act to drive good practice and compliance."

            FOI consultant Martin Rosenbaum told the BBC this was a welcome decision.

            "It is the kind of firm and determined action which has been badly needed to tackle serious failings on
            FOI
            in government departments.

            "It should make it clear to the public authorities with the worst records on FOI compliance that there
            are
            limits to what they can get away with.</p>

        <p>If the new Commissioner continues to show much greater determination and effectiveness in enforcing the
            FOI
            Act, it will make a big difference to improving how the system can work in practise for the public
            benefit,"
            he said.

            <h4>Department for International Trade</h4>

            The ICO said DIT was late answering more than half of requests from January to March.

            The department's response times declined in 2021 despite no significant increase in requests or known
            resource issues at the department.

            The ICO said the delays were "simply due to internal process failings, rather than more significant
            problems".</p>

        <p>The department has been told it must respond to any outstanding requests older than 20 working days
            within 35
            calendar days of the enforcement notice.

            It should also publish an action plan formalising measures to mitigate any future delays.

            Failure to comply with the notice could lead to the department being found in contempt of court, it has
            been
            warned.

            A DIT spokesperson said: "We are fully committed to our transparency obligations and responded to over
            500
            FOI requests received last year.

            "We continue to evaluate and improve our internal processes and will respond to the ICO in due course."
        </p>

        <h4>Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</h4>

        <p>BEIS was told to improve its performance, after it "consistently failed to respond to a significant
            number
            of the information access requests received within the statutory time limit".

            BEIS has had a 55% increase in requests since 2020, but the ICO found the department's internal
            procedures
            were the cause of many responses being delayed, as well as the volume increases.

            The ICO said that because of mitigations by BEIS and its positive engagement with the watchdog, it was
            only
            issued with a practice recommendation rather than an enforcement notice.</p>

        <p>But the regulator said an enforcement notice could be issued if performance does not improve.

            A BEIS spokesperson said: "We are committed to handling requests in a timely way while managing this
            alongside tackling the energy crisis and driving economic growth, and we are engaging with the ICO's
            office
            on the next steps."</p>
