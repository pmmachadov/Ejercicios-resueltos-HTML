        <br>
        <p>The government plans to move nuclear and renewable electricity generators to lower price contracts to cut
            bills,
            Prime Minister Liz Truss has said.

            "Renewable and nuclear generators will move on to contracts for difference, to end the situation where
            electricity prices are set by the marginal price of gas," Truss told Parliament.

            The price paid to these companies is often set by the most costly generator.

            That is currently hugely expensive gas.

            Moving nuclear and renewable generators onto lower-priced contracts "will mean that generators are receiving
            a
            fair price reflecting their cost of production, further bringing down the cost of this intervention," Truss
            said.

            <p>The government will ask renewable and nuclear generators to take up new 10 or 15-year contracts at fixed
                prices well below the current rates, sources familiar with the discussions say.

                Liz Truss says she won't introduce a windfall tax on energy companies, but she will need to address the
                issue of their huge profits.

                The energy market consultancy Cornwall Insight estimates energy prices are likely to be more than Â£40bn
                higher because of the fact that some electricity generators are being paid based on the hugely inflated
                gas
                price.

                That is a particularly pressing issue when the government is planning to spend tens of billions of
                pounds of
                taxpayers' money subsidising the nation's energy bills.

                Paying renewable energy companies less than the market price for gas would mean a very significant
                reduction
                in revenues for them, at least in the medium term.

                Yet RenewableUK, the industry body which represents most of the wind power companies in this group, has
                accepted this approach in principle.

                "We're keen to work collaboratively with the government" on the issue, RenewableUK's CEO Dan McGrail
                said.

                "It makes no sense to allow the exorbitantly expensive cost of gas to set the price for the whole of the
                electricity market", he said.

                How much are energy bills rising under the new plan?
                What is the windfall tax on oil and gas companies?
                What is fracking?
                RenewableUK represents most of the biggest renewable businesses in the UK including Orsted, Scottish
                Power,
                SSE, RWE and EDF.

                It confirms its members have had a "series of discussions" with the government on the issue and says it
                is
                waiting for the government to "take a position".

                So, why might they accept this huge potential hit to profits?</p>

            <p>RenewableUK says it is because the companies recognise it isn't fair for consumers to face such high
                prices
                at a time of national crisis.

                Those close to the discussions say they are probably also being offered a generous long-term price to
                reflect the short-term loss of profits.

                Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday that such
                long-term fixed-price contracts would have the effect of ensuring huge profits for electricity companies
                for
                years to come.

                "This is a proposal from (energy industry trade association) Energy UK, and let's be clear about this
                proposal: This would lock in massive windfall profits for these electricity generators.

                "Let me explain why: what Energy UK have said is we'll accept slightly lower prices now, so we can have
                much
                higher prices over the following 15 years.

                "This would be a terrible deal for the British people, a terrible deal for billpayers.

                "It is much better - if there are these unexpected windfalls, and there are - the right thing to do, the
                fair thing to do, is not to do some dodgy deal with these companies, but to do a windfall tax.

                Liz Truss may be ideologically opposed to windfall taxes but paying private companies billions of pounds
                in
                excess profits from the public purse is also a political liability.

                The companies know that if a solution isn't found she might deicide she has to hold her nose and impose
                such
                a tax, and that if she does, she might go after the billions of profits the companies have already made.

            <br>
            <p>Climate change is making adventure tourism more challenging and sometimes riskier, travel industry
                bodies,
                tour operators and experts have told the BBC.

                Rockfalls on some Alpine hiking routes this summer, wildfires that threatened campsites in southern
                Europe
                and the US, and landslides and floods affecting South American rafting rivers can all be seen as impacts
                of
                climate change, they argue.</p>

            <p>"The tourism sector is increasingly challenged by extreme weather events caused by climate change," says
                Dirk
                Glaesser, director of sustainable development for the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO).

                "The risks in adventure and nature-based tourism are different now, they require constant monitoring,"
                says
                Christina Beckmann, a climate expert with the Adventure Travel Trade Association (ATTA), whose members
                include 1,000 national tourism boards and 33,000 individuals.

                "The impacts of climate change mean we need to keep our eyes more open to respond to the changes, and
                keep
                reviewing our risk assessments."</p>

        <p>High-speed drones whizz along an avalanche's deadly wall of tumbling snow, rare Siberian tigers hunt
            hibernating
            prey, and microscopes capture ice breaking.

            More than a decade on from the first series, Frozen Planet II returns, using new technology to give BBC
            viewers
            an unprecedented insight into life in the coldest parts of our planet, many of which are under huge threat
            from
            climate change.</p>

        <p>It took the BBC Natural History Unit (NHU) four and a half years of filming across 18 different countries to
            produce the six-part series.

            The result, Sir David Attenborough reveals in the opening sequence, captures "natural phenomena never before
            seen by humans".

            The success of the series in revealing new animal behaviour has already led to one scientific publication on
            the
            Lapland bumble bee - with more expected to follow.</p>

        <p>From episode one, viewers will see an endangered Siberian tiger (also known as the Amur tiger) prowling for
            potential sources of food sleeping out the winter in caves - the first time this activity has been filmed.

            They are so elusive - with fewer than 550 left in the world - it took three years to get them on camera.</p>

        <p>The benefit of waiting 11 years for a new series is that camera technology has moved on considerably.

            Microscopes were used to film ice cracking below baby emperor penguins' feet as they made the treacherous
            journey to the sea. Motion-triggered time lapse cameras were set to catch a tiger on the move. The NHU even
            partnered with space-imaging experts to document the great ice melt on a global scale.

            Perhaps most impressive is the first ever use by the NHU of a new generation of light-weight fast-response
            drones.

            This enabled the team to capture the terrifying first-hand experience of flying down the mountainside
            alongside
            an avalanche.</p>

        <br>
        <p>These drones were also used to document a mammoth ice calving in Greenland - a fast and difficult to predict
            event.

            For more than four weeks the team watched on rotation for 24 hours a day, ready to send the drones nearly a
            mile
            across the ocean to reach the vast Store Glacier. The resulting clips immerse the viewer in towering blocks
            of
            ice, some 100ft (30m) high, as they break away from the glacier.</p>

        <p>Mark Brownlow, executive producer of the series, points out that Frozen Planet II is not just about capturing
            nice footage but also "draws attention to changes going on now".

            Greenland and Antarctica are currently losing ice six times faster than 30 years ago, and Greenland's ice
            sheet
            has been shrinking continuously for the last 25 years due to climate change, according to the UN.</p>

        <p>There is humour and heartbreak - and efforts to build a connection with the "characters" - as the series
            producer Elizabeth White likes to refer to the animals.

            In one sequence you're desperately willing newborn musk oxen to make it through the first days of their
            brutal
            lives in the barren world of the frozen tundra.

            Amid the animal drama it's easy to forget that someone was enduring the same extremes behind the camera to
            capture such moments.</p>

        <p>Alex Lanchester, Frozen Planet II producer, said that "the camera operator who filmed the musk ox story had
            to
            camp out in the Arctic in blizzard conditions".

            "He towed behind him a garden shed on his Skidoo and he lived in that."

            Besides the difficulties that always come with filming in the most treacherous places on Earth, this was all
            done during a global pandemic.

            One film crew had to quarantine for 42 days in South Africa before even beginning their trip to Antarctica.

        <p>Although the stars of Frozen Planet II are no doubt the animals, the series brings some A-list quality in the
            soundtrack.

            Hans Zimmer scored the music for the series, and worked with Camila Cabello to produce a new song for the
            trailer.

            Camila told the BBC: "To be able to combine my passion for the planet we live on and my music is a dream
            come
            true.

            "Sir David's narration is deeply powerful as we try to protect these incredible ecosystems from global
            warming."</p>
