                    <h3>In Georgia's remote Imereti region, monks scale the 40m-high Katskhi Pillar in a daring, nerve-jangling
                        ascent. The reason: to get closer to God.</h3>
                </p>
               
                <p>As I drove through the remote Imereti region of central-western Georgia, rolling hills and lush pine forests
                    flanked the empty roads and grazing cows dotted the verdant landscape. It was a picture-perfect rural scene.
                    Suddenly, the car rounded a bend and an incongruous sight appeared high above the canopy: up ahead, a
                    massive
                    limestone monolith jutted into the sky, about 40m tall, with a small church perched on the top.
        
                    I'd finally reached the Katskhi Pillar.
        
                    I had travelled 220km from Georgia's capital Tbilisi to visit this soaring stone structure. I'd long been
                    fascinated by the famous Greek monasteries of Meteora – which are also precipitously built on natural rock
                    pillars – and when I'd heard of an extraordinary church where daring monks climb to be closer to heaven, I
                    knew
                    I had to visit. Monks lived on top of the Katskhi Pillar for centuries; the last one only came down for good
                    in
                    2015. Today, it's a pilgrimage site for many Orthodox Christians, as well as a tourist attraction for people
                    who
                    flock here to here to witness the nerve-jangling sight of monks dangling off the steep rock edge.</p>
        
                <p>Dedicated to a monk named Maximus the Confessor, the church is one of the world's highest and most isolated
                    churches. It is thought to have been built somewhere between the 6th and 8th Centuries by Stylites, or
                    "pillar
                    monks", who believed that praying on top of pillars or high cliffs would distance them from worldly
                    temptations.

                    While this form of praying was popular in antiquity – one of the most renowned pillar monks is a Christian
                    ascetic named St Simeon Stylites, who reportedly lived for 37 years from 423 CE on top of a pillar in
                    Aleppo,
                    Syria – the practice has now become virtually extinct. Katskhi Pillar is one of the few remaining places
                    where
                    this extreme form of asceticism exists, albeit in a highly modified form.
        
                    This pillar is the symbol of the true cross. Even before there was a church on top, idols of Gods have been
                    found below the pillar
                    "Some monks are keen to give up all earthly pleasures and live and pray on top of pillars," said Father
                    Ilarion,
                    who lives in Katskhi Pillar Monastery below the monolith. "We feel being this high gets us closer to God."
                </p>
        
                <p>According to local legend, the Katskhi Pillar has always been a holy place and was once used by ancient
                    religions
                    for fertility rites. After Christianity was introduced to Georgia in the 4th Century, the pillar became a
                    place
                    of worship for Orthodox Christians.
        
                    "This pillar is the symbol of the true cross," said Father Ilarion. "Even before there was a church on top,
                    idols of Gods have been found below the pillar."</p>
        
                <p>Historians believe that monks started living on the pillar around the 10th Century, though they are still
                    unsure
                    how they reached the top, let alone carried the building materials to construct the church.

                    But in the 15th Century, when the Ottoman Empire invaded Georgia, this method of praying was abandoned and
                    remained so for centuries. "We don't know why exactly the monks stopped climbing up this pillar under the
                    Ottomans," said Tbilisi-based scholar Natia Khizanishvili, from the Korneli Kekelidze National Centre of
                    Manuscripts. "Despite the invasion of the Ottomans, in Western Georgia, Christianity was not in danger of
                    being
                    abolished."
                </p>
        
                <p>However, the church lay shrouded in mystery until 1944, when, for the first time in modern history, a group
                    from
                    outside the religious order scaled the pillar. "In 1944, Georgian writers Levan Gotua and Akaki Beliashvili,
                    architect Vakhtang Tsintsadze and alpinist Aleksandre Japaridze climbed the Katsakhi pillar and they found
                    the
                    ruins of the church," Khizanishvili explained.
        
                    The observations from the expedition, which found three hermit cells and a wine cellar in addition to the
                    church, revealed the pillar method of praying. "Tsintsadze, the architect, explored the ruins for several
                    hours
                    and linked it to a place of worship built by Stylites," Khizanishvili noted.
        
                    A few decades after this rediscovery, in the early 1990s, a monk named Maxime Qavtaradze revived the
                    Stylites'
                    method of praying. With the help of locals from the surrounding region and the National Agency for Cultural
                    Heritage Preservation of Georgia, he restored the sacred church to its former glory, using ropes and pulleys
                    to
                    transfer materials to the top, and even installed a 40m-long iron ladder to make scaling the pillar easier.

                <p>Father Maxime then climbed the ladder, renounced earthly life and lived at the sky-high church for more than
                    20
                    years, coming down only occasionally for prayer meetings in the monastery below. He spent most of his time
                    in
                    isolation, reading and praying, and had food supplies hauled up to him with the help of pulleys. However,
                    once
                    tourists started to arrive and the site no longer offered the peace and tranquillity it once did, he
                    descended
                    for good in 2015 and is now the current leader of the Katskhi Monastery.
        
                    "The pillar has become a tourist attraction and it is quite noisy around this site. So as monks we don't get
                    the
                    peace and seclusion we yearn [for] on top because we can still hear all the sounds below," Father Ilarion
                    explained. "So most of us, including Father Maxime, only go on top for a few hours and come back down."
        
                    Since the Stylite method of praying only allows one monk in the church at a time, monks from the Katskhi
                    monastery take turns to scale the ladder once or twice a week. Although no monks were climbing the day I
                    visited, Father Ilarion told me that the most daring monks, clad in their long black robes, make the
                    20-minute
                    ascent as free climbers, using only the rungs of the ladder for support (a less-terrifying option is to use
                    a
                    rope and harness). Monks must first seek Father Maxime's blessings; once they reach the top, they pray in
                    the
                    church and tend to the wine cellar where they make wine for the monastery. They then descend before dusk to
                    participate in the monastery's nightly prayer session.
        
                    My heart was in my throat just thinking about making the death-defying ascent, since just a thin steel
                    scaffolding encircles the ladder for safety. But "focussing on reaching the top helps," Father Ilarion told
                    me.
                    "The first time I climbed, I didn't dare to look down," he added. "But I have now got used to it and can
                    complete this deadly pilgrimage in about 15-20 minutes without a rope or harness."</p>

                <p>He explained that visitors are only allowed to ascend to the first level of the limestone pillar, where you
                    can
                    light candles and pray by a 6th-Century cross that has been enshrined into the monolith. Yearning to scale
                    at
                    least a tiny section of the rock, I jumped at the opportunity, climbing the narrow stone stairway
                    constructed
                    just behind the ladder. I soaked up the serenity for a few moments before climbing down to explore the
                    church of
                    Simeon Stylites, located at the foot of the pillar, which is adorned with beautiful artefacts and religious
                    paintings.</p>
        
                <p>Father Ilarion told me that even nuns who are in the same religious order aren't allowed to undertake the
                    dangerous pilgrimage to the summit. Rules in the Georgian Orthodox Church state that monks and nuns must
                    pray in
                    separate monasteries; while nuns are allowed to enter the religious complex, they have to pray at the church
                    of
                    Simeon Stylites below, which was constructed around 1999.</p>
        
                <p>"The reason why women aren't allowed to climb up this pillar to pray at the church on top is because they
                    aren't
                    pillar monks like us. We are different kind of monks who want to reach the highest points to pray," Father
                    Ilarion told me.
        
                    He explained that this rule isn't about gender discrimination in religion.</p>
        
                <p>As monks we believe that if men are the head, women are the spine. Both can't work without each other
                    "In Georgia, our first Queen Tamar, who reigned from 1184 to 1213, was also declared a saint by the Georgian
                    Orthodox Church. As monks we believe that if men are the head, women are the spine. Both can't work without
                    each
                    other. So, at this pillar the nuns support us below by giving us food and praying with us on important
                    occasions," he said.</p>
                </p>

                <p>While I was still intrigued to see what was at the top of the pillar, Kellerdashvili, another tourist
                    visiting
                    the pillar, had a different point of view. "I don't really want to climb to the top. Just looking at it from
                    below is heaven on Earth for me," she told me, glancing towards the top of the pillar in awe.
        
                    Monk Amirani, another monk at the Katskhi monastery, believes that such rules are important to preserve the
                    history and culture of Georgia. "When I climbed to the top of the pillar for the first time in 1992, I
                    realised
                    it is a special place and very important for Christianity," he said. "It is important that the rules of this
                    pillar are preserved. It is a spot to pray and for troubled men to find peace of mind and solitude."
        
                    But for Father Iliarion, whether or not you can climb to the top, anyone can find inner peace and solace
                    here.
                    "The world has many beautiful places but the main thing about this pillar is the serenity it offers," he
                    said.
                    "Before the limestone pillar existed, this entire region was the sea. Somehow, I can still feel the calming
                    presence of the sea in this place today, though it is miles away, making it the perfect spot to get closer
                    to
                    God."</p>

            <div class="text_news">
                <p>Climate change is making adventure tourism more challenging and sometimes riskier, travel industry bodies,
                    tour
                    operators and experts have told the BBC.</p>
        
                <p>Rockfalls on some Alpine hiking routes this summer, wildfires that threatened campsites in southern Europe
                    and
                    the US, and landslides and floods affecting South American rafting rivers can all be seen as impacts of
                    climate
                    change, they argue.</p>
        
                <p>"The tourism sector is increasingly challenged by extreme weather events caused by climate change," says Dirk
                    Glaesser, director of sustainable development for the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO).</p>
        
                <p>"The risks in adventure and nature-based tourism are different now, they require constant monitoring," says
                    Christina Beckmann, a climate expert with the Adventure Travel Trade Association (ATTA), whose members
                    include
                    1,000 national tourism boards and 33,000 individuals.</p>
        
                <p>"The impacts of climate change mean we need to keep our eyes more open to respond to the changes, and keep
                    reviewing our risk assessments."</p>
        
                <p>"Many places have now become no-go areas, mainly because of rockfalls and collapsing glaciers that have
                    destabilised them," says Jean-Claude Razel, a mountain guide who also teaches ecological transition at
                    France's
                    prestigious ESCP university.
        
                    <p>Several routes on the Alps were suspended by guides this summer because of frequent rockfalls, while a
                        glacier collapse in the Dolomite region of the Italian Alps killed 11 hikers in July.</p>
        
                    <p></p>In August, a French mayor said that climbers on Mont Blanc should pay a deposit to cover rescue and
                    possible funeral costs.
        
                    The chairman of Nepal's Mountain Guides Association, Ang Norbu Sherpa, says changes are occurring much
                    faster
                    than he and other professional guides had expected.
        
                    "You now see a stream flowing at Everest camp II. The rocks are exposed everywhere, and they are falling
                    everywhere," he says.
                </p>
        
                <p>He adds that seracs - pinnacles or ridges of ice on the surface of a glacier - are increasingly seen hanging
                    precariously over climbers' routes in the Himalayas and the Alps. Crevasses, meanwhile, are widening, Mr
                    Sherpa
                    says, to the extent that some can no longer be crossed.</p>
        
                <h4>Campsite wildfires</h4>
        
                <p>Wildfires led to the evacuation of hundreds of campers in Greece, France, Spain and California during this
                    summer's heatwave - highlighting a problem not only for adventure tourists, but for any camper who wants to
                    get
                    close to nature.
        
                    The number of such incidents has been on the rise in recent years, "and it will become more common now,"
                    says
                    Victor Resco de Dios, professor of forest fires and global change at the University of Lleida in Spain.</p>
        
                <p>In one incident in 2018, 103 people died in Mati, a Greek coastal village. It was vulnerable because it was
                    partly surrounded by forest, like many other spots popular with tourists, Prof Resco says.
        
                    "So these areas need to develop and implement plans to minimise risks and make evacuation routes, to ensure
                    that
                    they do not become mousetraps."</p>
        
                <h4>Troubled waters</h4>
        
                <p>Scientists have warned that landslides will become more frequent in many mountain regions, due to changing
                    rainfall patterns, and rafting guides say this is already happening.
        
                    Landslides pose obvious risks for rafters on mountain rivers, and according to Alejandro Buzzo, a Venezuelan
                    board member of the World Rafting Federation, they are making some rivers hard to navigate.
        
                    "That makes rivers change their course, with shallow depth, which makes rafting almost impossible," he says.
                </p>
        
                <p>"The Orinoco, the world's widest river, rose by an unprecedented 18m two years ago and that led to some small
                    islands being wiped out while new ones were created," he says. "I lost my own rafters' camping site, which
                    was a
                    small island, and it was swept away by the river."
        
                    In some areas, such as northern Spain, rafters have also suffered from low rainfall. Fermin Larrea, a guide
                    who
                    conducts rafting trips on the river Gállego, says water flow is now often just half of what is needed, and
                    that
                    periods of "low flow" have been getting longer.</p>
        
                <p>In addition, the temperature of the water has risen by 5C in recent years, causing guides to suffer more
                    frequently from a foot fungus that causes painful peeling of the skin.
        
                    "Very few guides used to have this before and now almost all of us have it. We continue to use anti-fungus
                    cream
                    as we used to before, but it is less effective."</p>
        
                <h4>Close to nature</h4>
        
                <p>Adventure tourism accounts for about 30% of all tourism according to ATTA, and some tour operators say this
                    figure is rising.
        
                    "After having to remain indoors for so long because of Covid, people want to travel now and many are now
                    willing
                    to go close to nature," says mountain guide Jean-Claude Razel.
        
                    "That's good, but given the increase in climate change impacts it can be bad if it is done without adequate
                    preparation and carefulness."</p>
